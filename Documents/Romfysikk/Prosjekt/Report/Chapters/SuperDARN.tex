\subsection{Super Dual Auroral Radar Network}

Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) is an international radar network used to map high latitude plasma convection in the F-region of the ionosphere, both in the northern and southern hemisphere.

In this project only the northern hemisphere is going to be studied. 

SuperDARN consist of multiple radars that measures the movement of the plasma, adding these together gives a picture of how the convection is in the ionosphere at the moment.
