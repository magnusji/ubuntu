\section{Interplanetary magnetic field and interaction with Earth's magnetic field.}

As observed on the satellite ACE there is a change in the magnetic field strength, this change to a negative direction is connected to the southward IMF. So there is a burst of plasma coming towards Earth, that will lead to reconnection and an auroral storm. This also means that there are plasma flowing that causes aurora. That there is reconnection is supported by the magnetograms from Svalbard and Bj\o rn \o ya. They show a change in the magnetic field strength a bit more than an hour later. So the solar wind has moved the IMF so that there can be reconnection and it from the data given by the ground-based magnetometers it also seems like that is whats happening. 



This reconnection causes the opened magnetic field lines to move back into the tail. When these magnetic field lines reconnect in the tail again and becomes closed field lines then the plasma can rush down the field lines and cause aurora. Also the magnetic field lines then move to the day side again as a part of the Dungey cycle.
