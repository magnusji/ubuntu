\subsection{Advanced Composition Explorer}

The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is a satellite that is positioned between the Earth and the sun, close to the first Lagrangian point (L1) and about 1.5 million km from the Earth. This gives the satellite a good view at the solar wind. It carries different systems with it including SWEPAM and MAG
